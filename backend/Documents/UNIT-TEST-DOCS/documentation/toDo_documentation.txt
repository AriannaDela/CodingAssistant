Sure, here is the documentation describing the functions without the actual code, just providing the function signatures.

To-Do List Application Documentation

Overview
This JavaScript code implements a simple to-do list application. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them. The application is initialized when the DOM content is fully loaded.

Functions

1. `createTodoApp`

Signature:
function createTodoApp()

Description:
This function creates the initial elements needed for the to-do list application and appends them to the document body. The elements include:
- An input field for entering new tasks.
- A button to add new tasks.
- An unordered list to display the tasks.

2. `addTask`

Signature:
function addTask()

Description:
This function handles the addition of new tasks to the to-do list. It performs the following actions:
- Reads the input value from the task input field.
- Validates that the input is not empty.
- Creates a list item containing the task text, a complete button, and a remove button.
- Appends the new list item to the task list.
- Clears the input field.

3. `handleTaskAction`

Signature:
function handleTaskAction(event)

Description:
This function manages actions on tasks, specifically marking tasks as completed or removing them. It performs the following actions based on the event target:
- If the event target is a complete button, it marks the task as completed by applying a text decoration.
- If the event target is a remove button, it removes the corresponding task from the list.

4. `addEventListeners`
Signature:
function addEventListeners()

Description:
This function adds event listeners to the add task button and the task list. It performs the following actions:
- Adds a click event listener to the add task button, which triggers the `addTask` function.
- Adds a click event listener to the task list, which triggers the `handleTaskAction` function for completing or removing tasks.

5. `init`
Signature:
function init()

Description:
This function initializes the to-do list application by performing the following actions:
- Calls the `createTodoApp` function to create the initial elements.
- Calls the `addEventListeners` function to add the necessary event listeners.

Initialization

The `init` function is called when the DOM content is fully loaded, ensuring that all elements are available for manipulation.

Event Listener:
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', init);

Summary
This documentation provides an overview of the to-do list application's functionality. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them. The functions are designed to create the necessary elements, manage task actions, and initialize the application when the DOM is fully loaded.
